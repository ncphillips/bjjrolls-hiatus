    <p class="text-2xl">We're on hiatus...for now.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>After a year of running BjjRols we've learned a lot.</strong> The
      value of recording and sharing trainging footage is clear.
      <strong>Students love it</strong> and get a ton of value from being able
      to review our training footage. But we've also learned that the process of
      <strong>recording and uploading footage is too cumbersome</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're working on a new approach that we hope will
      <strong> make recording and uploading content efffortless. </strong>
      Until then, we've decided to shut down the site to reduce costs.
